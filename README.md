# Privacy notice

Last updated: 30 August 2020

Thank you for choosing to use Takagi-san ("Takagi-san", "bot", "we", "our") in your Guild ("server", "guild"). In order to allow us to deliver all services, we may collect certain information about the guild containing Takagi-san.

## What information do we collect?

Takagi-san will store and use several pieces of non-identifiable information regarding yourself or other aspects of your server. We will never store any personally identifiable information unless it is explicitly provided by users of a server. It is the responsibility of said users to ensure that personal information is not shared. If you believe someone on the Discord platform ("Discord") is sharing your personal information without your consent, report it to Discord themselves at https://dis.gd/request. 

### Collected automatically
- Unique server IDs.
- Unique user IDs.
### Opt-in as required
- IDs for certain channels within your server when explicitly provided by a privileged member of your server.
- IDs for certain roles within your server when explicitly provided by a privileged member of your server.
- IDs for certain messages within your server when certain features have been enabled by a privileged member of your server. We never store message content from any user.
- IDs and names for certain custom emojis within your server when features requiring said emojis have been enabled by a privileged member of your server.
- Owner/author, name, aliases, number of uses, content and attachments of custom 'Tags' within a server.
- Custom welcoming messages when set by a privileged member of your server.

Please note that when a certain feature has been disabled by a privileged member of your server, any data required by that feature is also deleted, except where specified.

## Why do we store this information?

To allow us to deliver basic functionality, we store the items in the 'Collected automatically' field above. Items in the 'Opt-in as required' field are stored and deleted when the features relating to an item in the list are disabled.
We will **never** share any information provided or used with third parties as it would be both against our core values and also against the Terms of Service ("ToS") of Discord.

### The following can be deleted by server owners on request
- Server IDs are stored in order to allow us to store basic settings that are unique to your server. This includes, but is not limited to, linking custom prefixes to servers, providing customised experiences within a server when settings are changed from their defaults.
- User IDs are used in conjunction with server IDs in order to allow us to provide 'level' information and other features when explicitly enabled by the user whom the ID pertains to.

### The following is automatically deleted when features requiring the information are disabled
- Channel IDs are stored when requested to enable certain features including, but not limited to, welcoming channels, level-up channels, message/member logging channels (more information on those below) and Starboard channels.
- Role IDs are stored when required in order to provide functionality known as "Self-assignable roles" and "Reaction roles".
- Message IDs are stored when features requiring them are used. This includes, but is not limited to, reaction roles and Starboard.
- Emoji IDs and names are used for reaction roles when they are enabled within a server.
- Tag information is used to provide full functionality relating to the Tag feature. All information relating to Tags is either required for basic functionality or provided explicitly by the member who created the Tag. It is up to the user creating the Tag to ensure that no personal information is in the Tag. Deleting a Tag will also delete all of our information about it, including content, aliases, and the other previously mentioned data.
- Welcome message content used to send a personalised message to a user when they join your server. It is up to the user setting the message to ensure that no personal information is in the message.

## How long do we keep this information and how do I delete it?

The above information is stored until the feature requiring the information is disabled. At which point, the information used by the feature is removed. The basic information will be kept for the lifetime of the bot or until the owner of the guild the information pertains to requests for it to be removed, whichever comes first. Please note that once the basic information is removed, you will no longer be able to use the bot in your server and if you do wish to again start using the bot, you are assumed to agree with the basic information being stored again. 

For convenience purposes, once the bot has been removed from the guild all information stored will remain in case you wish to re-add the bot to your server. To remove the data relating to optional features, simply re-add the bot to your server, disable said features and then remove the bot again. If you are a server owner and wish to have the basic information deleted, please join our Discord server at https://takagisan.xyz/support and send a private message to apex#2504 (Discord user ID: 397869855749177345).

## Public information

Takagi-san contains certain features that will display basic information about a Discord user on the condition that they are in the same server as the person invoking the feature. This information will contain their Discord name, ID, account creation date and other basic information about their relationship with the server (join date, roles, etc.). This information is provided publicly by the Discord API and absolutely none of it is personally identifiable unless the concerned user makes it so. However, we understand that some people may want to keep this private. Therefore, if you want to be excluded from our basic userinfo command, please join our Discord server at https://takagisan.xyz/support and send a private message to apex#2504 (Discord user ID: 397869855749177345). Be aware that if you opt out of this feature, you will not be able to view the basic information about other users either. Also be aware that Discord already provides this information in other ways and we simply make it easy to access and display.

### Note about logging
Takagi-san includes a feature which assists moderation in the form of logging. If this feature has been enabled, it will display the content and author of messages that have been deleted in the guild, as well as the previous and new content of a message that has been edited. We strongly recommend that the logging channel is set to a private one which only moderators can access. Additionally, we recommend that you make users fully aware that logging is active in the server and give them the option to leave if they do not agree to it. **We do not store the content of edited or deleted messages in logging**. All we do is send it in the specified logging channel. We have no control over what the messages say and will never store it unless the message was used as part of a feature (for example, in a Tag).

## With whom do we share this information?
Server members will be able to view some information including, but not limited to, levels and ranks, Tags and some channel settings. Information will **never** be shared to any person or entity outside of the guild the information is connected to. Similarly, we will never sell information or use the information for any purpose outside of the feature it is related to.

## How can I view the information you have stored?
You will never be able to view information about a guild that is not the one you are currently in. Those with elevated permisssions and privileges within a guild will be able to view settings and the like. As stated, it is the responsibility of the person configuring the settings to ensure that no personal information is shared as it may be visible to other members of the guild in the case of welcome messages and Tags. 

## Do we store information on minors?
Discord is not to be used by anyone under the age of 13. If you suspect someone is under the age requirement, please report it to Discord at https://dis.gd/request. As we do not intentionally store any personal information about our users or general message content, we have absolutely no way of knowing the age of our users and it is the responsibility of server owners to ensure that all members of their server are above the age requirement.

## How can I contact you?
Join our Discord server at https://takagisan.xyz/support and send a private message to apex#2504 (Discord user ID: 397869855749177345).
